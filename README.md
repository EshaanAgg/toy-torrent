This is my solution for the ["Build Your Own BitTorrent" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/bittorrent/overview) in GoLang.

In this challenge, I build a BitTorrent client that's capable of parsing a `.torrent` file and downloading a file from a peer. It helped me to learn about how torrent files are structured, HTTP trackers, BitTorrentâ€™s Peer Protocol, pipelining and more. Later I also add support for magnet links, which are a way to download files without needing a `.torrent` file.
